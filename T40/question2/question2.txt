 Create a Java program to simulate a restaurant management system. The system should
 have the following classes:
 1. MenuItem: This class should represent a menu item with properties like name, price,
 and category (e.g., appetizer, main course, dessert).
 2. Order: This class should represent a customer’s order, including a list of menu items
 and the total cost.
 3. Waiter: This class should represent a waiter who can take orders, process payments,
 and deliver food.
 4. Kitchen: This class should simulate the kitchen, receiving orders from waiters, prepar
ing food, and notifying waiters when orders are ready.
 Tasks
 1. Create Menu: Implement the MenuItem class and create a menu with various items,
 categorized as appetizers, main courses, and desserts.
 2. Take Orders: The Waiter class should allow customers to order items from the menu.
 3. Process Orders: The Waiter should send orders to the Kitchen class.
 4. Prepare Food: The Kitchen class should simulate food preparation time and notify
 the Waiter when an order is ready.
 5. Deliver Orders: The Waiter should deliver the prepared food to the customer.
 6. Calculate Bill: The Waiter should calculate the total bill for the customer’s order,
 including taxes and any discounts.
 Optional:
 1. Error Handling: Implement error handling for situations like out-of-stock items or
 invalid orders.
 2. User Interface: Create a simple text-based user interface to interact with the system.
 3. Data Structures: Use appropriate data structures like ArrayLists or HashMaps to store
 menu items, orders, and customer information.
 4. Concurrency: Consider using threads to simulate concurrent order processing and food
 preparation.
